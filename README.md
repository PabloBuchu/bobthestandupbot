# Hi everyone meet Bob The Standup Bot

This is a very simple bot implementation for presenting powerful 
python API for creating useful tools.

# Getting started

1. Install all the dependencies from requirements.txt ([virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) and [virtualenwrapper](https://virtualenvwrapper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
2. Get credentials from Slack. See [official manual](https://api.slack.com/bot-users) for howto. 
3. Put your keys in .env.template and rename it to .env 
4. Run `python3 bot.py` & have fun.
